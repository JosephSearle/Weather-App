# Getting Started with Weather App

1. Pull changes onto your local machine.
2. In weather-app directory add .env file.
3. In .env file create the two variables below:
    REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAP_KEY={google maps API key}
    REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY={openWeather API key}
   NOTE: You may have to subscribe to openWeather API 3.0 but don't worry it won't cost you a penny.
